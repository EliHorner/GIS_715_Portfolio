            <p> <strong>Map 1</strong> shows the breakdown of happiness scores in countires in Western Europe by the six explanatory factors:
            GDP per capita, Social Support, Life Expectency, Perceptions of Freedom to make life choices, Charitable giving, and Perceptions of corruption.
            The map shows how much each of these factors contribute to the total happiness score for countries in western Europe, but does not show the
            total score. This is to try and see whether the patterns of what contributes to these countries scores is similar or different, regardless
            of how high the scores are. </p>

            <p><strong>Map 2</strong> shows the breakdown of happiness scores in countries in Western Africa by the same explanatory factors as the map above.
            This visualizatoin allows the viewr to see and estimate not only the percent contribution of each factor, but also an idea of the total
            happiness socre by imagining stacking the bars together. While this overall socre estimate will not be exact, it does give a general idea of what
            countries have higher scores, and can be used along with the percentages shown in the bars to determine if there are any patterns between
            what factors are prevalent in a country and its overall happiness score. </p>
