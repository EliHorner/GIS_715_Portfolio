            <p> <strong>Map 1</strong> shows the breakdown of happiness scores in countires in Western Europe by the six explanatory factors:
            GDP per capita, Social Support, Life Expectency, Perceptions of Freedom to make life choices, Charitable giving, and Perceptions of corruption.
            The map shows how much each of these factors contribute to the total happiness score for countries in western Europe, but does not show the
            total score. This is to try and see whether the patterns of what contributes to these countries scores is similar or different, regardless
            of how high the scores are. </p>

            <p><strong>Map 2</strong> shows the breakdown of happiness scores in countries in Western Africa by the same explanatory factors as the map above.
            This visualizatoin allows the viewr to see and estimate not only the percent contribution of each factor, but also an idea of the total
            happiness socre by imagining stacking the bars together. While this overall socre estimate will not be exact, it does give a general idea of what
            countries have higher scores, and can be used along with the percentages shown in the bars to determine if there are any patterns between
            what factors are prevalent in a country and its overall happiness score. </p>

            <p><strong>Map 3</strong> shows the trees in the Denver Zoo. The glyphs show both the location of the tree, and the size
          of the symbol shows the number of stems, with larger symbols indicating more stems. This map could be used by tree enthusiasts 
          to help find the trees with the most stems in the zoo. </p>

            <p><strong>Map 4</strong> shows the breakdown of happiness scores in countries in Southeast Asia and their GDP per capita. This
          map is a bit of a hybird between a glyph and a chloropleth map, where instead of using a different shape, I used the shape of the country
          as the glyph. In this map, the color represents the country's happiness score and the level of transparnecy represents the country's GDP
          per capita, where wealthier countries are more opaque. </p>

            <p><strong>Map 5</strong> shows data collected by hand on what people were wearing down a walk around campus. Each person is represnted
          by a cirle with a line through it. If the top of the circle is shaded, this indicates the person was wearing, long sleeves, a jacket, or an
          equivalent, while no color in the top half indicates short sleeves, no sleeves, or similar. If the bottom half of the circle is shaded, this
          indicates the pserson was wearing long pants, a long dress/skirt, or similar, while an unshaded bottom half of the cirle indicates
          shorter length pants, dres, skirt, etc. The circle at the bottom represnts me, the data collector, on that day. </p>
