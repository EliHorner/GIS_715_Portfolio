            <p> <strong>Poster 1</strong> hihglights the methods used to quantify and partition uncertianty of Sudden Oak Death infections
            as part of my research, along with some preliminary results. This poster as presented at the NSF PIPP conference held at
            North Carolina State University on April 5, 2023. The abstract associated with the poster is written below: </p>
        <p>
            Understanding the dynamics of uncertainty in process-based models and forecasts of
            Sudden Oak Death (SOD) infection can improve forecast accuracy and informs better
            management strategies that account for uncertainties. Partitioning uncertainty to its sources
            reveals valuable avenues for building better forecasts, as knowing the dominant sources of
            uncertainty in a forecast can help guide data collection and other model improvements. Process-
            based models such as the Pest or Pathogen Spread model (PoPS) allows for detailed analysis of
            uncertainties and the partitioning of forecast uncertainty to its sources. Using two different
            methods of uncertainty analysis, uncertainty in PoPS predictions of SOD infection are quantified
            and partitioned to their sources. Preliminary results show that process and parameter uncertainty
            are responsible for a majority of the uncertainty in forecasted SOD infections.

            <p><strong>Poster 2</strong> is an inforgraphic highlighting the importance of quantifying and partitioning
            uncertainty in ecological forecasts, specifically those of Sudden Oak Death. The infographic explores the 
            sources of uncertainty in the Sudden Oak Death system, and preliminary results of how the uncertainty can be 
            partitioned out over two years.</p>
